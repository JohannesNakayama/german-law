# Laws under Version Control

The purpose of this project is to make national and international law transparent and accessible.
Changes to laws appear as diffs in this repository, so you can easily link to a particular change to make it more accessible to public discourse.

Inspired by [a similar project by the German Piratenpartei](https://github.com/Piratenpartei/gesetze).
